        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey Ya'll my name is Austin (they/them) and I'm a bassist, radio DJ and HIV educator based here in New Orleans. I'm currently workig twords y bachelors of music in music industry studies at Loyola University New Orleans, and I'm also pursuing a minor in public health.</p>
            <p>Growing up in a family of artists and musicians has given me the confidence to pursue my creative passions but it has also given me a perspective into the realities of life as a touring musician. I owe a lot to my second family back home in the Dallas punk scene, who've taught me what it means to look out for one another.</p>
            <p>Through my podcast, I hope to uplift the voices of local artists and bring queer health and radical politics to the forefront of the conversation. It's my own little way of acting up.</p>

        <h2>About WHIV</h2>
            <p>102.3 FM WHIV-LP is a program of The New Orleans Society for Infectious Disease Awareness (NOSIDA), which was established in 2009 by local activist and infectious diseases physician Dr. MarkAlain Dery. NOSIDA's focus is to raise awareness about HIV and other infectious diseases through music. Such illnesses are completely preventable, yet disproportionately affect disadvantaged and marginalized populations. NOSIDA received its non-profit status in 2010. <a href="https://www.whivfm.org">Learn More</a></p>
